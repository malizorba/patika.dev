Project 1 Insertion short
[22,27,16,2,18,6] --- Insertıon sort
1-Write the steps of the given above sequence according to the sort type.
2-Write the Big-O notation.
3- Time complexity: Avarage case : The number that  we are looking for is in the middle of sequence
   Worst case: The number we are looking for is at the of the sequence
   Best case : The number we are looking for is at the beginning of the sequence
4- What case does the number 18 get involved after the array is sorted? Write.
  
  
5-[7,3,5,8,2,9,4,15,6]  write first 4 steps according to insertion sort
  
 1-  [22,27,16,2,18,6]
     [2,27,16,22,18,6]
     [2,6,16,22,18,27]
     [2,6,16,18,22,27]

2- O(n²)

3-  Average case:O(n²/2) 
    Worst case:O(n²)
    Best case:O(n) 
    
4-   avarage case    

5- [3,7|5,8,2,9,4,15,6]
   [3,5,7|8,2,9,4,15,6]
   [3,5,7,8|2,9,4,15,6]
   [2,3,5,7,8|9,4,15,6]
